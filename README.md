# airpollution-PostCode-LookUp

Air pollution data provided by defra is divided into grids of square kms, this project aims to create lookup table for joining air pollution data with UK PostCodes.

This is done by first getting x, y coordinates for post codes then diving the coordinates into per square meter grids and then joining it with the air pollution data.
